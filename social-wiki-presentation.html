# Issues with classic Wikis
- a single version per page
 - work done by one person can be undone by another (leads to "edit wars")
 - gives the impression that the current version is "authoritative"
 - is not suitable for topics where finding a NPOV is difficult or undesirable

---
# In comes SocialWiki
- multiple versions per page are possible
- editing a page doesn't delete the page; instead it creates a new page referring to the old one as its parent 
 - that's actually already the case in many wikis, but...
- following a wikilink returns a list of *all* versions of the page

---
# But... which version should I select?
- you need to do some work, and that's the whole point!
 - realize that the latest version isn't necessarily the greatest
 - but we provide ways to rank the versions according to various criteria/metrics
 - to do this, you need to "socialize"...

---
# Putting the "Social" in SocialWiki
SocialWiki proposes some common social networking metaphors:
- "like" a wiki page
- "follow" a wiki user
It also computes a "favourite" version or each user.  

---
# Crowd Metrics vs. Social Metrics
- SocialWiki uses "likes" and "follows" for various metrics that the user can use to rank page versions, in particular:
 - page popularity: most "liked" page
 - peer popularity: most "followed" peers
 - peer similarity: based on which pages were "liked"
 - peer distance: distance between peers in the social network created by the "follow" action  
- For these metrics to work, the user needs to participate, by "liking" and "following" often!
- Note the difference between rankings that depend on crowd choices (popularity) vs. those that are more personalized

# Uses in the classroom
- assignments
- note-taking
- ?

Two SYSC courses have used Social Wiki so far. How about you?

# Next?
- improve user interface
- more guinea p... I mean more instructors
- adoption as a cuLearn plugin
- convince MOOC platforms?
