# What is Git?
- A distributed version control system
- created by Linus Torvalds to solve his own problem

---
# Installing Git
http://git-scm.com/

- comes with GUI tools
- but on Mac or Linux, can just use the terminal
- on Windows, can use the Powershell, or use Git Bash that comes with Git Gui

---
# `git init`
- creates a local repository (or just a "repo" if you're a cool kid) in current folder

---
# `git status`
- is your best friend!
- tells you if you have any files that you have changed
- use it often to figure out where you are
- try it now!

---
# `vi hello-world.txt`
- create a file you want to work on, using your favorite editor
- what does `git status` say now?

---
# `git commit` 
- *commits* your changes, i.e. create a new version/snapshot in the repo
- try it. What happens?


---
# `git add hello-world.txt`
- Oops! You needed to *stage* your changes to commit first
- type the above command
- now what does the fo.. I mean `git status` say?  

---
# `git commit`
- now we're getting somewhere!
- you are asked to enter a commit message. Keep it short but informative. You'll use these messages later to know what each snapshot was all about.

---
# `git log`
- tells you the history in your current branch (more on branches later)
- notice how each commit is identified by a hash. You can use this hash (or I believe the first few digits thereof) to refer to a given snapshot, and to check it out later.
- your other BFF! Use it often.
